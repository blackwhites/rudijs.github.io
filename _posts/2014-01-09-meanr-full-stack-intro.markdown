MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node.js and Redis - MEANR

MEAN and MEANR stacks are great for modern full stack Javascript web development.

There are some really good starter boiler plates and apps like:

* [mean.io](http://mean.io/)
* [ngbp (formerly ng-boilerplate)](https://github.com/ngbp/ngbp)
* [yeoman.io](http://yeoman.io/)

But how do you get your MEAN app from your local environment to a production site?

How can you do this professional manner with team development, automated testing and proper
<br/>deployment stages from local to staging to quality assurance and then to production?

[MEANR Full Stack](https://github.com/rudijs/meanr-full-stack) looks to address each of these questions.

MEANR Full Stack is boiler plate that comes with a simple AngularJS 'Articles' app<br/>with DevOps and Deployment.

DevOps is automated infrastructure (servers) with [Chef](http://www.getchef.com/)

Deployment is with [Capistrano](http://capistranorb.com/)

Check out the repo and docs for more overview, installation and usage details here:

In the coming days and weeks I'll be publishing some screencasts<br/>that will step through installation and usage.
