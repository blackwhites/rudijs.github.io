## Overview

In this post we'll look at how to use Webpack to compile Angular2 Typescript code
for development and production builds.

At the time of writing Angular2 is still in Beta (2.0.0-beta.9).

There are several excellent working examples of using Webpack with Angular2 but those examples are
already built out extensively, hence they start you off at the "deep end".

The focus in this post is to start from the "shallow end".

I'll demostrate starting from scratch and build up a basic working example that includes
builds for **both** development and production.

We'll use two resources for this demostration:

1. A "How to play-by-play" youtube video screencast.
2. A github repository of the code we'll create for your reference.

There will be three short video screencasts in this series:

1. Setup and development builds.
2. Production builds.
3. Some extra essential Webpack build features for real world apps.
